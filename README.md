# KeyGen v1.0.1

**KeyGen** is an *open source random password generator*.  
It has been created on July 30, 2014.

This the first version of KeyGen, made using pure PHP source code: without any framework behind it.  
KeyGen v2 is available and work along with [Oli](https://github.com/OliFramework/Oli), an open source PHP framework made by [myself](https://github.com/matiboux/).

### Start using it

**You use the service directly with the official KeyGen v1: https://data.matiboux.com/keygen/.**

You can also host your own version on your webserver.  
[Download the latest release](https://github.com/matiboux/KeyGen-v1/releases/latest), extract the files and put them on your web server. Once this is all done, open your browser and type the URL to your hosted KeyGen.

**Enjoy generating your own keygens!**
